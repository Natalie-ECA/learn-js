## Learn JS

#### Setup

`npm i`

#### Run tests

`npm test`

#### Instructions 

1) Turn off GH co-pilot. You will get more out of this learning experience by typing everything yourself and not getting hints
2) ChatGPT is 100% banned!
3) Remove `.skip` from the first test case in arrays.js, read it, run the tests and see why the test fails (read the error message)
4) Write the code in the function in arrays.js to pass the test
5) Go through the test cases and unskip them one by one, writing the code in the functions to pass the tests
6) Add more tests to the existing functions if you like
7) Now you're ready to start writing your own test cases and functions to practice using different array methods such as (but not limited to) lenght, splice, join, map, filter, reduce
8) Create a file objects.test.js and do the same for object methods


Tips:
* Read the error messages - they are your friend and will give you massive hints!
* Use resources such as [MSDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Arrays), stack overflow, W3 schools and blog posts to help you
